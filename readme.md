How to deploy:
 1. Fork this repository.
 1. Log in to your [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account (or create one).
 1. Add your fork on Vercel's dashboard and deploy.

That's it, your fork is now deployed on Vercel (it should look like [vite-plugin-ssr-demo.vercel.app](https://vite-plugin-ssr-demo.vercel.app)). It's continuously deployed: if you commit and push a change to your fork, then Vercel automatically re-deploys your app.
